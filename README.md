Third Deliverable for PUBPOL 543, Map Plot

This plot is a map plot that shows the average student debt of B.A. graduates and enrollment at U.S. flagship public colleges and universities.

Please see the .jpg file (Conkling_Deliverable_3_Map.jpg) to see the plot as it was meant to be seen. The preview shown in the .rmd or .html file does not present the proportions of the plot correctly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
